♠ My name is Vian. Or Rian. I really don't care what you call me honestly.
♠ I do HTML, I'm not good at it but I do it. I'll learn Lua eventually.
♠ I love to cook and I love to bake; bread and cookies and pies and cakes. I was convinced my mama was right, so I'm gonna bake a berry pie :)
♠ Yum diddy yum, yum diddy yay, I'm gonna bake a pie today
